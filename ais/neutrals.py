"""
Neutral players are AIs, though dumb ones.
Their main characteristic is to _never_ attack, hence never invade, hence never win.
Two special behaviours/functions are defined here (and are not exported) rather than in the dedicated modules.
Nevertheless, it is possible to define strong defenders.
Indeed, the problem that the other players might have, is to face neutral players building impenetrable citadels...
